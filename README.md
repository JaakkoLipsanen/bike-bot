# bike-bot

This is a personal Telegram bot that I use on my cycling trips, for example to get elevation graph between two places or to upload blog posts I have written on my [blog writing app for Android](https://github.com/JaakkoLipsanen/Blogger) for [my blog](https://flai.xyz/blog)

Written in strict **Typescript** on top of Node.js
